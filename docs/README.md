# Documents

Documents can be viewed at <https://homelab.khuedoan.com>.
It's running on my other cluster in the [khuedoan/horus](https://github.com/khuedoan/horus) project
(so if the homelab goes down I can still read the documentation).

To view locally, install [`mdbook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook#installation) and run:

```
mdbook serve
```
